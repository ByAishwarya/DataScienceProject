    "## 🔍 Key Findings & Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Insights:**\n",
    "1. **Random Forest consistently outperforms** all other models across all datasets in both R² score and Accuracy (±15%)\n",
    "2. **Full attributes dataset yields best overall performance** - Random Forest achieves R²=0.4716 vs 0.3845 with reduced features\n",
    "3. **Linear models (Linear/Ridge/Lasso) show minimal differences** - nearly identical performance across all metrics\n",
    "4. **Feature reduction impacts tree-based models most** - Random Forest performance drops significantly from full to reduced features\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Efficiency Analysis:**\n",
    "1. **Training Time**: Random Forest is slowest (401s full, ~8s reduced), Linear Regression fastest (~0.07s)\n",
    "2. **Prediction Time**: All models are fast (<1.5s), with Linear/Ridge/Lasso being fastest\n",
    "3. **Speed-Accuracy Trade-off**: Random Forest offers best accuracy but slowest training; Linear models offer fastest training but lowest accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Behavior:**\n",
    "1. **Tree-based models** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting) benefit more from additional features\n",
    "2. **Linear models** show minimal improvement with additional features\n",
    "3. **Decision Tree** offers best balance of speed and performance among tree-based models\n",
    "4. **Gradient Boosting** shows consistent but not exceptional performance across datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metric Observations:**\n",
    "1. **R² Score**: Ranges from 0.322 to 0.472 (best)\n",
    "2. **Accuracy (±15%)**: Ranges from 71.03% to 78.21% (best)\n",
    "3. **RMSE**: Ranges from 14.87 to 16.84 (lower is better)\n",
    "4. **MAE**: Ranges from 10.02 to 12.00 (lower is better)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For maximum accuracy**: Use **Random Forest with full attributes** (R²=0.4716, Acc=78.21%)\n",
    "2. **For production with constraints**: Consider **Random Forest with top attributes** (good balance of speed and accuracy)\n",
    "3. **For rapid prototyping**: Use **Linear Regression** (fastest training, reasonable performance)\n",
    "4. **For interpretability**: Consider **Decision Tree** (good performance, fast, interpretable)\n",

    "### Evaluation Metric Consideration\n",
    "For my evaluation I didnt consider Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), because it was giving me really really high values, like exponential to 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happened because because a lot of Target Values (Popularity) were close to 0, and since MAPE is calculated like this: |actual - predicted| / actual × 100\n",
    "\n",
    "In the denominator it's actual, in many cases it as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence MAPE was not suitable for my dataset."

    "## Training Note: Grid Search Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Experimental Observation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During this study, I attempted to perform **Grid Search hyperparameter optimization** but only for the **top attributes dataset** due to computational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Grid Search was limited to top attributes only:**\n",
    "1. **Computational Complexity**: Grid Search with full attributes would have been computationally infeasible\n",
    "2. **Parameter Interactions**: Parameters interact strongly with genre attributes, creating complex search spaces\n",
    "3. **Time Constraints**: For the top attributes dataset with grid search:\n",
    "   - 432 candidate parameter combinations\n",
    "   - 5-fold cross-validation for each\n",
    "   - **Total: 2,160 model fits**\n",
    "   - **Estimated training time: 4-5 days** on my current hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Challenge:**\n",
    "- Even after adjusting hyperparameters, computational time remained prohibitive\n",
    "- My PC hardware couldn't support the extensive computation required\n",
    "- This highlights the exponential complexity growth with feature count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvement Strategy:**\n",
    "For future work, I plan to implement **Random Search with 20 iterations**  because:\n",
    "1. **Faster convergence**: Random search often finds good parameters faster\n",
    "2. **Better computational efficiency**: 20 iterations vs. 2,160 fits of grid search\n",
    "3. **Proven effectiveness**: Research shows random search can outperform grid search in high-dimensional spaces\n",
    "4. **Practical feasibility**: Can be completed within reasonable timeframes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication for Results:**\n",
    "The current model performances represent **baseline performances without extensive hyperparameter tuning**. The reported metrics could potentially be improved with proper optimization using more efficient search strategies."
